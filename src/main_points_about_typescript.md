# Main points about TypeScripts

* All Javascript is valid TypeScript.
* TypeScript files have a .ts extension.
* By default, browsers do not read TypeScript - so it has to be transpiled into JavaScript.
* To compile TypeScript files into JavaScript files, an external compiler is used.
* TS is used in a variety of JS frameworks - including Angular.
